# 📊 Comprehensive Nigeria Health Analysis
This project explores trends and patterns in public health data across Nigeria using SQL. It analyzes multiple health burdens—ranging from causes of death, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), to infectious diseases—across dimensions like time, gender, and disease category.

<br>

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset, titled Comprehensive Nigeria Health Dataset, is a compilation of health indicators sourced from multiple domains:

NCD/Mental Health Indicators

Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) Indicators

Infectious Disease Indicators

General Nigeria Health Indicators (including mortality data)

Variables include:

indicator_name, year, cause_name, indicator_value, sex, and age_group.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
SQL (PostgreSQL): Core analysis

Jupyter Notebook (Python + Pandas/Seaborn): Visualizations

SPSS & Excel (optional): Cross-checking values

GitHub: Portfolio deployment

## 🔍 Key Analyses & Insights
### 1. 🏆 Top 10 Leading Causes of Death in Nigeria
Query: Ranked top causes excluding aggregate groups
Insight:

#1: Lower Respiratory Infections (1,942 deaths)

#2: Cardiovascular Diseases (1,626 deaths)

#3: HIV/AIDS (913 deaths)

Significant mortality also from injuries, stroke, digestive, and diarrhoeal diseases.

### 2. 📈 Mortality Trend Analysis (2000–2012)
Query: Yearly mortality patterns for top 10 causes
Insight:

Cardiovascular Diseases: ↓ 3.8% from 829 to 797 deaths

HIV/AIDS: ↑ 26.4%, indicating peak epidemic era

Diarrhoeal Diseases: ↓ 63.5%, likely due to better sanitation & ORS adoption

### 3. 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️ Gender-Based Mortality Trends
Query: Top 10 causes by sex
Key Findings:

Men: More deaths from injuries & digestive diseases

Women: More affected by HIV/AIDS, stroke, and cancer

Shared: Respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are top for both

### 4. 📉 BMI vs NCDs (2000–2016)
Query: Relation between mean BMI and deaths from cardiovascular diseases & diabetes
Findings:

BMI increased from 22.1 to 23

Diabetes mortality: ↑ 60%

Cardiovascular disease mortality: ↑ 26%

Diabetes is more sensitive to BMI changes than cardiovascular diseases

### 5. 🦟 Burden of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)
Query: Aggregate disease burdens and trend patterns
Highlights:

Onchocerciasis (River Blindness): 432M treated—most common NTD

Trachoma: 82K surgeries & 52M treated

Guinea Worm: Sharp decline; almost eradicated

Buruli Ulcer & Leishmaniasis: Persist in smaller pockets

### 6. 🤒 Infectious Disease Surveillance
Query: Total and annual burdens of vaccine-preventable diseases
Top Concerns:

Measles: Over 2.9M cases (highest of all diseases)

Pertussis & Meningitis: High and volatile yearly spikes

Polio & Neonatal Tetanus: Near-eradication levels in recent years

Cholera & Leprosy: Still pose regional public health challenges

## 📊 Visual Example
📌 Measles Cases (Trends from 1980s to 2018)

Peak in 1999 with over 217K cases

90% drop by 2018

Sharp anomalies in 2006 and 2016 possibly reflect outbreaks or underreporting


## 🎯 Project Goals
Showcase data querying skills with real-world health datasets

Identify public health challenges for data-driven policy decisions

Build a portfolio project highlighting analytical and epidemiological insight

## 📌 Future Improvements
Add Power BI or Tableau dashboard

Expand gender and age group analyses
